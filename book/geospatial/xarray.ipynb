    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev) is a powerful Python library designed for working with multi-dimensional labeled datasets, often used in fields such as climate science, oceanography, and remote sensing. It provides a high-level interface for manipulating and analyzing datasets that can be thought of as extensions of NumPy arrays. Xarray is particularly useful for geospatial data because it supports labeled axes (dimensions), coordinates, and metadata, making it easier to work with datasets that vary across time, space, and other dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the basic concepts and data structures in Xarray, including `DataArray` and `Dataset`.\n",
    "- Load and inspect multi-dimensional geospatial datasets using Xarray.\n",
    "- Perform basic operations on Xarray objects, such as selection, indexing, and arithmetic operations.\n",
    "- Use Xarray to efficiently work with large geospatial datasets, including time series and raster data.\n",
    "- Apply Xarray to common geospatial analysis tasks, such as calculating statistics, regridding, and visualization."

    "## What is Xarray?\n",
    "\n",
    "Xarray extends the capabilities of NumPy by providing a data structure for labeled, multi-dimensional arrays. The two main data structures in Xarray are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataArray**: A labeled, multi-dimensional array, which includes dimensions, coordinates, and attributes.\n",
    "- **Dataset**: A collection of `DataArray` objects that share the same dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Xarray is particularly useful for working with datasets where dimensions have meaningful labels (e.g., time, latitude, longitude) and where metadata is important."
