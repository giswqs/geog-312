    "[Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/) is a Python library that allows you to read, write, and analyze geospatial raster data. It is built on top of GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) and provides a simple, Pythonic interface to work with raster datasets, such as satellite images and digital elevation models (DEMs)."
