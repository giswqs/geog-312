    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab introduces Google Earth Engine (GEE) for accessing and analyzing geospatial data in Python. You will explore diverse data types, including DEM, satellite imagery, and land cover datasets. Youâ€™ll gain experience creating cloud-free composites, visualizing temporal changes, and generating animations for time-series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Access and visualize Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data for a specific region.\n",
    "2. Generate cloud-free composites from Sentinel-2 or Landsat imagery for a specified year.\n",
    "3. Visualize National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data for U.S. counties.\n",
    "4. Display watershed boundaries using Earth Engine styling.\n",
    "5. Visualize land cover changes over time using split-panel maps.\n",
    "6. Create a time-lapse animation for land cover changes over time in a region of your choice.\n"
