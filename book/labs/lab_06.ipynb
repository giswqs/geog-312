    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will practice handling multi-dimensional geospatial datasets using `Xarray` and `Rioxarray`. This includes working with NetCDF climate data and georeferenced raster datasets (GeoTIFF files). You will learn how to perform data selection, arithmetic operations, resampling, and reprojection, as well as saving your results back to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work with Xarray datasets (NetCDF format) and inspect geospatial raster data.\n",
    "* Apply common data operations like slicing, resampling, and arithmetic analysis.\n",
    "* Reproject, clip, mask, and resample raster datasets.\n",
    "* Export processed data to various formats such as NetCDF and GeoTIFF.\n",

    "1. Load the Xarray tutorial dataset `rasm`.\n",
