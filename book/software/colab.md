# Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a free cloud service that supports free GPU and TPU. It is a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use. It allows you to write and execute Python code in the browser and save your code in Google Drive. It also provides a way to share your code with others.

```

10. To upload a file (or several) from your computer, run:

```python

```

11. To download a file, run:

```python
from google.colab import files
files.download('path/to/your/file')
```

12. **“Open in Colab” Badge:** You can add a `Open in Colab` badge to a markdown file or jupyter notebooks using the following markdown code:
