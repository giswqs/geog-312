    "# GeoPandas\n",

    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/giswqs/geog-312/blob/main/book/geospatial/geopandas.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org) is an open-source Python library that simplifies working with geospatial data by extending Pandas data structures. It seamlessly integrates geospatial operations with a pandas-like interface, allowing for the manipulation of geometric types such as points, lines, and polygons. GeoPandas combines the functionalities of Pandas and Shapely, enabling geospatial operations like spatial joins, buffering, intersections, and projections with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the basic data structures in GeoPandas: `GeoDataFrame` and `GeoSeries`.\n",
    "- Create `GeoDataFrames` from tabular data and geometric shapes.\n",
    "- Read and write geospatial data formats like Shapefile and GeoJSON.\n",
    "- Perform common geospatial operations such as measuring areas, distances, and spatial relationships.\n",
    "- Visualize geospatial data using Matplotlib and GeoPandas' built-in plotting functions.\n",
    "- Work with different Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) and project geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data structures in GeoPandas are `GeoDataFrame` and `GeoSeries`. A `GeoDataFrame` extends the functionality of a Pandas DataFrame by adding a geometry column, allowing spatial data operations on geometric shapes. The `GeoSeries` handles geometric data (points, polygons, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "A `GeoDataFrame` can have multiple geometry columns, but only one is considered the active geometry at any time. All spatial operations are applied to this active geometry, accessible via the `.geometry` attribute."
