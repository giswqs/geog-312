    "# Miniconda\n",
    "\n",
    "[Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda) is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib, and a few others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Miniconda, download the installer from the [Miniconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda) and run the installer. The installer will ask you to accept the license agreement, choose the installation directory, and add the conda path to your shell profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Miniconda, you can open the **Anaconda Prompt** or **Terminal** to create a new environment and install packages required for this course using the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n geo python=3.11\n",
    "conda activate geo\n",
    "conda install -n base mamba -c conda-forge\n",
    "mamba install -c conda-forge geemap leafmap\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing Conda in Windows Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "If you did not add Conda to your PATH during installation, you can do it manually:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open the Start Menu** and search for \"Environment Variables.\"\n",
    "2. **Click on \"Edit the system environment variables.\"**\n",
    "3. In the System Properties window, click on **\"Environment Variables.\"**\n",
    "4. Under \"System Variables,\" find the **`Path`** variable and select it.\n",
    "5. Click **\"Edit\"** and then **\"New.\"**\n",
    "6. Add the following paths to the list:\n",
    "   - `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\miniconda3\\Scripts`\n",
    "7. Click **\"OK\"** to close all windows.\n",
