    "# Files and Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces how to work with files and handle exceptions in Python, with a focus on geospatial data. Working with files is a common task in geospatial programming, whether you are reading data from a file, writing results to a file, or processing large datasets. Exception handling is crucial for writing robust code that can handle errors gracefully."
