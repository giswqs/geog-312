# Introduction to GIS Programming

Welcome to the official course website for "_Introduction to GIS Programming_," offered at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, during Fall 2024.

## Course Overview

This course offers a comprehensive exploration of GIS programming, centered around the Python programming language. Throughout the semester, students will master the use of Python libraries and frameworks essential for processing, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial data.

### What You'll Learn

- **Fundamentals of Python**: Start with the basics—variables, data types, data structures, string operations, looping, and control statements. Progress to more advanced topics, including functions, classes, file handling, and exception handling.
- **Geospatial Applications**: Delve into Python’s application in the geospatial realm. Learn to create interactive web maps using Leafmap, visualize vector and raster data, and explore 3D mapping with MapLibre. You'll also get hands-on experience with a number of specialized geospatial libraries, including GeoPandas, Rasterio, WhiteboxTools, Geemap, SAMGeo, HyperCoast, DuckDB, Xarray, and more.

- **Hands-On Experience**: Engage in practical labs and projects designed to reinforce the concepts covered in lectures. These activities culminate in a final project where you'll apply your skills to a real-world geospatial problem.

By the end of the course, you will have a robust understanding of Python programming, specifically tailored to geospatial analysis and visualization, empowering you to confidently tackle various geospatial challenges.
